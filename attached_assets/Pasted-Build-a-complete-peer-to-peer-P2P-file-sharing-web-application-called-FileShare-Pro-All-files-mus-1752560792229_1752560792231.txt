Build a complete peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing web application called FileShare Pro. All files must be placed in a single directory (no subfolders). The app should support create room, join room, upload, download, and real-time file sharing.

🖥️ Frontend
Use React 18 + TypeScript

Use Tailwind CSS (inlined via CDN or single CSS file)

Use shadcn/ui components (no component splitting, write everything in one file)

Use Wouter for routing

Use TanStack React Query

Build with Vite but output should be editable in one HTML file (if possible)

Include QR code generator logic in the same file

UI Components:

Welcome UI with "Create Room" and "Join Room" buttons

Single component to handle both room creation & file upload

Show QR code (base64 inline)

Upload area (file input + status updates)

Download list for users in the same room

🔧 Backend
Use Express.js + TypeScript

Use WebSocket (ws) for real-time connection (in same file)

Use Multer to handle multipart/form-data file uploads

Use PostgreSQL for persistence with Drizzle ORM

Define tables using Drizzle:

rooms – unique room codes

connections – connected clients

fileTransfers – metadata about uploaded files

All code should be in one server.ts file, with comments and modules written inline.

📁 File Handling
Store files in uploads/ folder, but define upload logic in same backend file

Serve uploaded files through Express endpoints

Broadcast available files via WebSocket

🔄 WebSocket Features
Handle:

Room creation

Join room

Device connection status

File list updates

Include reconnect logic in frontend

🧠 Smart Features
Generate QR code inline (use qrcode npm library or inline logic)

Detect local IP using WebRTC in frontend

Notify all users when a file is uploaded (via socket)

📦 Deployment & Build
All code in one directory

Frontend entry: index.html, main.tsx, style.css — but can be merged if needed

Backend entry: server.ts — with WebSocket, Express routes, and DB code inline

.env config inline at the top of server code

Build with vite build (if needed) but keep source editable without any folders

⚙️ Required Libraries
express, ws, multer, drizzle-orm, @tanstack/react-query, tailwindcss, vite, wouter, qrcode, pg, dotenv, tsx

➕ Bonus: Add PWA manifest and service worker inline if possible.

✅ Ensure the app works with just one folder, with all code in one place and no subdirectories.
